# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and PyTorch

The goal of this project is to teach you the fundamentals of Machine Learning in
python. It contains the example code and solutions to the exercises in the first edition of my upcoming O'Reilly book [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and PyTorch (1st edition)](https://homl.info/er):

**Note**: If you are looking for the notebooks for the TensorFlow/Keras version of this book, check out [ageron/handson-ml3](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3).

## Quick Start

### Want to play with these notebooks online without having to install anything?

- <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-mlp/blob/main/" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a> (recommended)

âš  _Colab provides a temporary environment: anything you do will be deleted after a while, so make sure you download any data you care about._

### Just want to quickly look at some notebooks, without executing any code?

- <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ageron/handson-mlp/blob/main/index.ipynb"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg" alt="Render nbviewer" /></a>

- [github.com's notebook viewer](https://github.com/ageron/handson-mlp/blob/main/index.ipynb) also works but it's not ideal: it's slower, the math equations are not always displayed correctly, and large notebooks often fail to open.

### Want to run this project using a Docker image?

Read the [Docker instructions](https://github.com/ageron/handson-mlp/tree/main/docker).

### Want to install this project on your own machine?

Start by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) (or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)), [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and if you have a PyTorch-compatible GPU, install the [GPU driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx), as well as the appropriate version of CUDA and cuDNN (see PyTorch's documentation for more details).

Next, clone this project by opening a terminal and typing the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/ageron/handson-mlp.git
    cd handson-mlp

Next, run the following commands:

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate homlp
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=python3

Finally, start Jupyter:

    jupyter notebook

If you need further instructions, read the [detailed installation instructions](INSTALL.md).

# FAQ

**Which Python version should I use?**

I recommend Python 3.12. If you follow the installation instructions above, that's the version you will get. Versions 3.10 and 3.11 should work as well, but some libraries are not yet available for 3.13.

**I'm getting an error when I call `load_housing_data()`**

If you're getting an HTTP error, make sure you're running the exact same code as in the notebook (copy/paste it if needed). If the problem persists, please check your network configuration. If it's an SSL error, see the next question.

**I'm getting an SSL error on MacOSX**

You probably need to install the SSL certificates (see this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27835619/urllib-and-ssl-certificate-verify-failed-error)). If you downloaded Python from the official website, then run `/Applications/Python\ 3.12/Install\ Certificates.command` in a terminal (change `3.12` to whatever version you installed). If you installed Python using MacPorts, run `sudo port install curl-ca-bundle` in a terminal.

**I've installed this project locally. How do I update it to the latest version?**

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

**How do I update my Python libraries to the latest versions, when using Anaconda?**

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
